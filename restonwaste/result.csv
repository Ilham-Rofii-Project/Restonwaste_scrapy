20th Anniversary for Reston Waste,https://www.restonwaste.co.uk/news/20th-anniversary-for-reston-waste/,"20th Anniversary for Reston Waste That’s right, this month at Reston Waste we’re celebrating a huge milestone for the company: 20 years of business!  We’re immensely proud of everything we ’ve achieved over the years, having been founded back in September 2001 by Andrew and Sharon Reston. In 1999 the pair started London Rubbish Clearance, before transforming into Reston Waste Management Limited two years later. Beginning with just one hired truck at that time – which Andrew drove while Sharon was the one-woman office force – we’ve now grown to a fleet of over 40 dealer-maintained trucks.
We serve commercial and domestic customers across London and the surrounding areas with three depots in Wimbledon, providing reliable and professional service when it comes to waste. Whether it’s skip hire, waste management or rubbish clearance, we’ve earned a reputation as one of the leading companies in the region through our hard work and industry knowledge.
2012 marked a huge stepping stone for the company, as we opened our own material recovery facility in Wimbledon. This facility processes over 75,000 tonnes of waste annually and operates around the clock to help divert 100% of the waste we receive away from landfill.
Most crucial to our continued success, however, is the people involved at Reston Waste. Our staff has expanded over the last two decades to a team of over 100-strong, and it’s these people who keep the business operating day in, day out at such high levels.
We want to thank our team and our customers for helping us reach this massive milestone – we look forward to celebrating many more years of success together.

How to Avoid Overloading a Skip?,https://www.restonwaste.co.uk/news/how-to-avoid-overloading-a-skip/,"How to Avoid Overloading a Skip?
Never fill a skip beyond its maximum load capacity. Not only could it land you a hefty fine, but it could also endanger the lives of others around you. In this article, discover some tips and tricks that will help you to fill your skip safely.  Why shouldn’t you overfill your skip?
If you’ve ever tried to hire a skip, you may have noticed that virtually every skip hire company enforces a strict no-overfill rule. We do this to protect you, our staff and others who may walk nearby. Here are some reasons why you should never overfill your skip: Objects can fall out and injure somebody
As any good jenga player knows, the higher you build your tower, the more likely it is to come crashing down. The same can be said for skips; the maximum capacity level is the highest point that your waste is stable. Beyond that, you risk objects falling out and causing injury. Even if they don’t directly hit anyone, fallen objects may damage property or block access points.
The skip is dangerous to transport It is extremely unsafe to remove and transport an overflowing skip. Almost every  skip hire company
will flat out refuse to move it, as they don’t want to endanger their staff. You will then be forced to reassemble the waste in your skip or hire a second one.
You will be fined
It is against the law to fill your skip above its maximum load level. If you are caught doing so, you could be hit with a hefty fine. Plus, you may face serious legal action if someone is injured by a falling object.
How high can you fill a skip? Every skip has bold red lines that indicate its maximum fill level. None of the waste you place in your skip should exceed this level. How to fill a skip?
You can save a lot of space by loading your skip methodically instead of mindlessly throwing everything in. The key is to deconstruct or flatten your items, separate them into categories, and then place each category into the skip in layers, aiming to fill every available space. Separate your waste into four categories: 
Flat items
– such as cardboard and paper
Tessellate objects
–  such as bricks and tiles
Bulky items
– such as furniture and appliances
Debris
– such as soil and sand
Begin with your flat items. Flatten them down as much as you can and then place them into your skip so that you cover the entire base. Once the first layer is complete, repeat with a second layer.
The same technique should be applied next for tessellated objects. Lay the items in layers to cover all available space. The tessellated items must go into the skip after the flat items, as the tessellated items will weigh the flat items down to create more space.
Bulky items must be deconstructed into their core parts, e.g. table legs should be removed from the tabletop. Once this is completed, lay your waste into the skip, once again in layers to fill all available space. Imagine this sequence like a game of tetris: identifying the optimal places to put various shapes so that every space is filled. Finally, pour debris into the skip to fill all remaining pockets of space. How to choose the right size of skip
Most skip hire companies offer skips in various sizes. It’s important you choose the right one for your project. Pick one that’s too small and you’ll end up overfilling it and need to hire another. Pick one that’s too large and you will have needlessly overpaid.
Our skip size guide  can help you identify the perfect skip for your needs. Are there alternatives to skip hire?
If you’re unsure which skip size you’ll need or are concerned about overloading, there are other options. Reston Waste offers domestic waste removals and rubbish collection for swift and efficient
clearance . Our team will visit your home and remove your waste then and there, with no skip involved. Skip hire,  waste removal  and  rubbish collection  are just some of the services we provide as  waste management

House Clearance: What Size Skip Do I Need?,https://www.restonwaste.co.uk/news/house-clearance-what-size-skip-do-i-need/,"House Clearance: What Size Skip Do I Need?
Since we’re all spending a lot more time at home at the moment, you might be looking around and thinking that it’s a time for a change. Whether you’re planning on ripping out large fixtures and fittings or you simply want to clear out your possessions to make more room, skip hire is ideal for a house clearance.
The trouble is, what size skip is best for house clearances? You don’t want to order a skip too large and overpay, but at the same time, you don’t want to go too small and end up having to order another one – either way you end up paying more than you have to.
With this dilemma in mind, at Reston Waste, we’ve put together a quick and easy guide to getting the right skip for your house clearance project as well as some general advice.
What size skip do I need for a house clearance? At Reston Waste, we have a wide range of  skip sizes  to help you with your house clearance, here’s a full list of our sizes:  
4-yard skip
6-yard skip
8-yard skip
10-yard enclosed skip
12-yard skip
14-yard skip
Now you know the sizes we offer, how about a little bit of context? Let’s talk about the different kinds of house clearance projects our skips are good for. Starting off small with a clearing out of the attic or garage, maybe there are lots of boxes which simply need throwing away – including old magazines, books, clothes or scrap building materials. For this, we’d recommend a
4 or 6-yard skip , small, but effective with 5 and 8-tonne capacities respectively. Moving on, you might be clearing out the entirety of a room to make way for a renovation. Whether it’s your garage which you plan to convert and needs clearing or an update to a bedroom where pieces of furniture need clearing, our
8, 10 or 12-yard skips  can take your house clearance waste.  For bigger projects, perhaps where you’re clearing a house to be renovated or have large suites of kitchen furniture or bathroom fixtures to be thrown out, our
14-yard skip  is ideal. This allows you to take on light refurbishments or house clearance projects without having to worry about the disposal of your waste. What can go in a skip?
It’s important to know what can go in your skip so that you’re certain you’re disposing of your waste in the proper, responsible way. Papers and fabrics from garage and attic clearances are acceptable, as is any wooden furniture or metal and plastic from your plumbing if you’re carrying out larger renovations. If you’re getting rid of tiling as part of your renovations, we can take that waste as well.
What not to put in a skip
There will also be restricted materials which you won’t be able to throw in your skip as part of a house clearance, including things like chemicals, solvents and liquid waste you might have lying around in your garage. We’re also not able to take batteries, oils or tyres, as these should be taken to a local recycling centre for proper disposal. If you’re tackling a kitchen renovation project, please note we can’t take fridges, freezers or other electrical equipment. Asbestos is also not allowed to be taken as part of skip hire house clearance due to the hazardous nature of the material.
Alternatives to skip hire If you’re looking to get rid of waste without having to use a skip and want professional help, at Reston Waste we also offer a domestic  waste removal service . This service is perfect for light, bulky waste as we utilise a fleet of waste clearance vehicles to take your waste away promptly and efficiently.  Whichever service you decide you use for your house clearance project, you can have peace of mind knowing that we aim to recycle 100% of the waste we collect from you, minimising the impact your waste will have on the environment. We’ve been serving Wimbledon and the surrounding areas of London since 1998, so you can count on us when you need to clear your house of rubbish. Simply  contact our team  today to arrange the service you need or  order your skip  for house clearance online with our simple ordering system.

How to Stop Fly Tipping on Private Land,https://www.restonwaste.co.uk/news/how-to-stop-fly-tipping-on-private-land/,"How to Stop Fly Tipping on Private Land If someone fly tips on your land,  you are responsible for clearing it.   Becoming a victim of fly tipping can be a serious burden. After removing the fly-tipped waste and reporting the incident, it’s vital to take precautions to prevent it happening again. This article will explain the laws around fly tipping on private land, and how you can prevent fly tipping from happening on your property. What is fly tipping? Fly tipping is the illegal deposit of waste onto land that does not have a license to accept it. Fly tipping can contribute to an area appearing run down and unsafe. It may also spur others to dump waste in the same area, leading to a buildup of unsightly and hazardous waste. You can be imprisoned and fined up to £50,000 for fly tipping in the UK.  Fly tipping on private land law If waste has been dumped on your land, you will be responsible for the appropriate removal of the waste.  If you find waste on your property, follow these steps: 
Be cautious — some waste may be hazardous. We don’t recommend opening up bags or drums.
Record as many details about the incident as you can and photograph the waste. This will aid the investigation.
Report the incident through the
gov.uk website
Arrange for disposal of the waste with a registered waste carrier
Keep full details of your clearance and disposal, including documentation and cost.
Reporting fly tipping
Report the incident through the gov.uk website. If waste is dumped on public land, many local councils will launch an investigation and clear the waste free of charge. If the waste is hazardous, the Environmental Agency may step in to oversee the investigation. For private land, the council may charge you a fee to collect the waste. Many larger items are blacklisted and won’t be removed at all. For prompt, affordable removal of fly-tipped waste, we recommend using a waste disposal company.  Companies like Reston Waste offer  fly-tipping clearance  amongst a range of waste removal services. Professional companies can handle light and bulky waste, and will even  recycle  as much of it as possible. How to prevent fly tipping If someone has got away with fly tipping on your property, they are likely to reoffend. Prevent recurrence with these tips: 
Install barriers or gates
Install CCTV
Install motion-activated lights
Keep skips inaccessible to others
Check your insurance cover for fly tipping
Lock all gates and other entrances into your property
Fly tipping statistics The following statistics relate to a one year period between 2018 and 2019 in the UK: 
There were approximately 1 million fly tipping incidents dealt with by UK councils.
A third of all fly tipping incidents were equivalent to a ‘small van load’.
3% of incidents were ‘tipper lorry’ size. Just these incidents alone cost local authorities £12.9 million in clearance costs.
The most common place for fly tipping to occur is on roads.

Skip Permits Explained,https://www.restonwaste.co.uk/news/skip-permits-explained/,"Skip Permits Explained
Skip hire in Wimbledon and the wider London area is a great way to quickly and responsibly get rid of your waste. However, if you plan to have your skip placed outside your property on the road, you will need to get a permit from your local council.
Skip permits tend to be one thing which puts people off the idea of hiring a skip, but it’s not as complex as you might think. This month at Reston Waste, we’re going to talk you through
skip hire
permits, including when you need one, how much they cost and the alternatives – all with the aim of making it easier for you to dispose of your waste.
Do I need a permit for a skip?
An easy way to work out if you require a skip permit or not is to ask yourself where you’ll have the skip situated. If it’s on your driveway or placed in your garden, then you don’t need to do anything.
If, however, you need to have the skip placed on a road, even if you think it isn’t a frequently used road, you will no doubt require a permit so that the local authority is aware of it. You may even require a bay suspension in some circumstances.
If you’re not sure if you need a permit, you can speak to our team at Reston Waste and our skip permit team will be happy to provide you with advice and guidance on this matter.
How much does a skip permit cost?
Skip permit cost varies from council to council but you can usually expect to pay roughly £30. The amount of time you want to keep your skip on the road may also impact the cost, but only if you intend to keep it there for longer than usual.

The Problem of Fly Tipping & Illegal Waste Dumping and How it Costs Us All,https://www.restonwaste.co.uk/news/problem-fly-tipping-illegal-waste-dumping-costs/,"The Problem of Fly Tipping & Illegal Waste Dumping and How it Costs Us All
Most waste is relatively easy to get rid of in the UK, with councils offering comprehensive collection services for both rubbish and some recycling.
Although the exact services vary from council to council, everyone benefits from free collection as a result of paying their council tax.
But what happens when the amount of rubbish you have far exceeds your allowance? Or if you have bulky items which can’t be disposed of the normal way.
Fly tipping a sure fire way of destroying the appeal of a neighbourhood
Most individuals understand that it’s their responsibility to dispose of the rubbish in a moral and ethical manner, either by hiring a skip, or taking it to a recycling or refuse centre. For lots of larger items, you could even pay for a
waste management company
to get rid of it cleanly, efficiently and quickly.
Unfortunately there are a few individuals who are loathed to do the right thing, instead opting for the illegal option – and creating the problem of fly-tipping.
We take a closer look at fly tipping and illegal waste dumping and examine just why it’s so much of a problem, and how diligent members of the community end up paying the price.
What is fly tipping?
If you have heard the phrase but aren’t sure what it means, ‘fly tipping’ refers to the practice of dumping waste illegally.
Rather than using tips, skips or waste disposal companies, fly tippers simply dump their rubbish in a place where they hope they won’t be spotted. This might be in a neighbour’s yard, on the street or frequently out in the countryside.
The potential effects of this are nothing short of horrific.
The effect of fly-tipping
Depending on the type of rubbish and waste which is being dumped, there could be all kinds of harmful substances and materials which shouldn’t be out in the public.
Household goods may contain substances which could kill a wild animal if ingested, and no explanation is needed about the potential suffocation and strangulation dangers of plastic.
For larger items, there is a risk to children if they are inadvertently allowed to play near them. A big campaign was launched many years ago about removing the doors from fridges because of the huge risks to children becoming trapped.
And of course it’s not just the wildlife, the planet itself suffers too. Dumping a load of waste affects the ground and the local ecosystem on many different levels. As well as presenting a danger to animals, the earth could absorb toxins preventing future growth of greenery or even worse, permitting poisons to enter the plants, thus reaching even more insects and creatures.
Any community which suffers from fly tipping can quickly gather a bad reputation as being run-down, dirty and shabby. This reputation can be enhanced by what a pile of rubbish can attract. Rotting food and other materials can attract droves of flies as well as enticing rodents to collect in the area.
Rats are actually a fairly common occurrence but tend to keep away unless there’s a ready supply of food they can access. As disease-carrying animals they are one of the least-welcome pests and can be difficult to eliminate.
Fly tipping isn’t just an eyesore; it can actually present a very real danger to human health too.
The cost?
The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) estimates that it costs in the region of £4million every month for councils to deal with the nuisance of fly tipping. An extraordinary amount of money being wasted for no good reason.
Like the rest of the council’s budget, where does this money come from? That’s right, the local tax payer.
This means that members of the community who abide by the rules and pay their taxes end up footing the bill for those who are seeking to find a free way to dump their waste illegally.
The amount of money wasted clearing up fly tipping is excruciating, and could be put to far better use in communities, reducing the pressure on the budget.
For this reason, the Environment Agency provides a 24 hour hotline for individuals to report the problem of fly-tipping, or you can tell the police. Fly tipping is a crime that affects everyone, taking money out of your pocket and increasing the risk of disease.
Conclusion
Don’t be tempted to ignore the crime of fly tipping: it’s costing you money and could be pushing down the value of your home. Fly tipping and illegal waste dumping harms the environment, hurts our wildlife and brings vermin and potential disease to the area too.
There are so many easy waste disposal options to get rid of rubbish, there’s never any excuse for fly tipping.

5 Ways To Reduce Your Commercial Waste Costs,https://www.restonwaste.co.uk/news/5-ways-to-reduce-your-commercial-waste-costs/,"5 Ways To Reduce Your Commercial Waste Costs
Running a business can be hugely costly, and so it’s important that those costs are kept to a minimum. One of the biggest expenses that companies face is the management and disposal of waste. It can be difficult to keep costs down if you manage a business that generates a considerable amount of waste, and so in these cases, it would be better to keep that waste to an absolute minimum. If you reduce waste and take other factors into consideration also, you’ll be able to lower costs in no time, and here’s how to do it.
Throw less away
This can be problematic if your industry is known for generating large amounts of waste, however, the amount you throw away can still be reduced, regardless of the volume produced. In order for this to be successful, there are a number of things you should consider:
The major sources of waste
The amount of packaging that comes with different products
Implementing a waste management process, if you don’t already have one
Find out where the majority of waste is being generated
By identifying the main sources of waste generation, you can make changes to that specific area of your business, such as reusing materials or refraining from using as much in the first place. Perhaps have an incentive or a reward for the employee who produces the least amount of waste a month or choose a supplier who uses less packaging.
There will always be areas where the amount of waste generated could be cut down, so it’s important to quickly identify them and implement changes to reduce the amount of waste your company produces as a whole.
Donate and reuse
Donating or reusing materials can help to reduce commercial waste costs, particularly if a third party can come and collect the materials themselves. There are many businesses who have arrangements with local charities where they donate food or clothing. Reusing certain materials within your business will also reduce the amount of waste you generate, meaning you’ll only need to pay for a midi skip as opposed to a 12 yard skip to dispose of your unwanted waste materials.
Aim to get the best prices
When it comes to hiring a waste management company, it’s essential to get several quotes from around the area, ensuring you’re getting the best deal possible when it comes to waste disposal.
However, it’s important to note that a waste management company who offers an exceptionally low price may not be entirely reputable, meaning your waste could end up being fly-tipped on private land. If the waste is traced back to your business, you could be landed with huge fines and possibly go to prison. You must conduct the right checks and consider a reasonable price as opposed to a ridiculously cheap one.
Checks to conduct when hiring a waste management company
Have a browse through their website
Read reviews online
Go and visit the premises
Is the waste carrier registered?
If a mobile number is the only point of contact, then avoid this company
If they offer a price which is either exceptionally low or high, then avoid them
If their waste management solution is a man in a van, avoid them
The importance of hiring a reputable waste management company
You could risk being prosecuted for fly-tipping
You’ll have peace of mind that your waste is disposed of responsibly
Waste will be removed in an efficient, timely manner
You will always receive excellent service
A cost assessment will be conducted to give you a fair and reasonable price
Recycle where possible
If the majority of the waste you generate goes to landfill, then it’s important that you recycle as much as possible. Here at Reston Waste, we aim to recycle 100% of the waste we collect, so you can count on the quick, efficient and responsible disposal of your waste every single time. We have a specialist
waste transfer and recovery facility  dedicated to the sustainable disposal of as much waste material as possible –  take the Google tour!
Audit your facility
Appoint an employee to monitor the amount of waste that is disposed of. This can even include encouraging peers to use the recycling bins or showing them how certain materials and products can be reused as opposed to being thrown away. Implementing change can be highly beneficial, only it needs to be initiated, monitored and supported by your employees for the new system to work and for you to start reaping the financial benefits.
Here at Reston Waste, we’re able to provide professional
waste management
solutions for commercial settings. Whether you’re in need of specialist
waste removal
services or prompt, reliable

Recycling electrical equipment,https://www.restonwaste.co.uk/news/recycling-electrical-equipment/,"Recycling electrical equipment
Although there are lots of options for waste disposal, including
skip hire
for those occasions when you’ve got lots to get rid of, it’s important to explore the possibilities for recycling first.
There are restrictions on how electrical equipment can be disposed of as the government is keen for as much as possible to be recycled. Some types of electrical equipment cannot be placed into a skip, and can only be collected via specific arrangements.
Here’s a look at electrical equipment and the potential for recycling.
Did you know?
Around 170 million electrical items are bought every year, which works out at around 3 items per person in the UK.
As new items are purchased, around 1 million tonnes of electronic and electrical waste is produced every year. However, just 1.8kg of every 5.9kg of electrical equipment is recycled, just a small fraction of what could be re-used.
Even items which are no longer in good working order can be recycled. As an example, there’s enough steel in one iron to create 13 steel cans.
The Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) Regulations were enacted in January 2007; this legislation was launched in an attempt to increase the recycling rates and decrease the amount of electrical equipment going to landfill.
Electrical equipment includes mobile phones, kitchen appliances, TVs, electric tools and computers.
Why it’s important to recycle electrical equipment
If the item is still in good working order, you could help to raise money for charity by donating it to a good cause. It could either then be sold or given to those who are in need.
But helping others in need or raising money isn’t the only reason why recycling is important; it also reduces the pressure on landfill, which in turn helps the environment.
Landfills are bursting at the seams, and by recycling items rather than simply discarding them, you can play your part in helping to reduce the problem.
Items that end up in landfill can cause contamination of the soil and water as hazardous substances leech out. This can be harmful not just to the environment and the local wildlife, but potentially even the human population too.
Recycling helps to preserve the planet by reducing the toxic waste created from landfill and also saving energy and resources.
Here at
Reston Waste Management
, we try and recycle as much as possible, only sending waste to landfill when absolutely necessary.
How are electrical items recycled?
Although an item may no longer be fit for purpose, you could be surprised at how the components could be recycled for alternative use.
Here’s a look at what some of the most common items contain:
mobile phones – contain precious metals including palladium, gold and platinum which can be used for electrical components (low voltage) or plating. They also contain zinc which can be combined with copper to create brass or to galvanise steel. Zin blocks are also useful in the shipping industry to prevent rust.
games consoles – contain steel which can be used for car parts and computer casings. The circuit boards also contain precious metals which can be used in the same way as those found in mobile phones.
hover mowers – contain a strong type of plastic known as ABS which can be used to create mouldings used on car bumpers, musical instruments, pipes and cases. Motors made from copper which can be taken apart to create copper wire, currency and jewellery.

Going green leaves SMEs seeing stars as confusion reigns,https://www.restonwaste.co.uk/news/green-leaves-smes-stars-confusion-reigns/,"Going green leaves SMEs seeing stars as confusion reigns
As the temperature cranks up on the need to recycle it seems that many of the nation’s businesses are less than clear about what they are supposed to be doing.
Admittedly not the sexiest of subjects, a recent survey revealed that the vast majority of SMEs didn’t have a clue about what they should be doing with their hazardous waste and recycling.
Fines and prosecution
Waste and recycling specialist company Biffa conducted a survey on 1000 small and medium sized business in the UK to identify whether they understand what they were supposed to be doing with their rubbish. The results were quite simply astounding.
Just one in five companies were getting rid of their hazardous waste legally, leaving a shocking 80% of businesses following illegal and potentially dangerous practices.
Britain has strict rules around the disposal of hazardous waste and failing to follow them can result in prosecution and a hefty fine.
Hazardous waste is a term used to cover a multitude of items ranging from household goods such as light bulbs and aerosols to industrial goods such as oily rags and batteries. Technology such as computer or electrical equipment is also considered to be hazardous waste.
Yes, batteries are classed as hazardous waste
Since 2005 there have been separate laws relating to these goods, and requires that they are collected separately to be treated and disposed of. Any items which have the potential to be harmful to either the environment or to the health of humans must be disposed of in this way.
Small amounts
One of the factors which can lead to confusion is the amount of waste which is required before it is considered to be hazardous and subject to its own legislation.
Many businesses believe that because the amount they get through is so trivial that the guidelines will not apply in their circumstances but that isn’t the case.
The CEO of Biffa, Ian Wakelin, admitted that many of the companies in the survey may only have been disposing of ‘tiny’ amounts of waste but said that there was a total lack of understanding about how the regulations apply.
He went on to explain, “… if your company throws out an old computer, polish cans or even a tin of leftover paint, by law they need to be treated properly.”
You can take control of what goes into the garbage truck
And this is how many SMEs could find themselves inadvertently breaching the law, and facing a huge fine.
Survey results
Many of the businesses admitted in their responses that staff may not have been properly trained to know what to do with the rubbish, with many saying that they had little confidence that recycling and waste disposal could be handled properly.
Almost one in three acknowledged that their staff wouldn’t be able to either identify or dispose of hazardous materials properly.
When asked to identify some of the most common items of hazardous waste, there were many types of product which were regularly overlooked. Wood, empty tins and cans and metal were the three materials which were the least recognised, scoring just 5%, 16% and 14% respectively.
Not complying with the regulations on the disposal of waste products doesn’t just carry the possibility of a heavy fine, there’s also a huge possibility of environment damage with detrimental effects on both the planet and the human population so these results will be a blow to environmental campaigners in Britain.

Householders fined for not using legitimate waste disposal firm,https://www.restonwaste.co.uk/news/householders-fined-using-legitimate-waste-disposal-firm/,"Householders fined for not using legitimate waste disposal firm
Fly tipping is an act which can blight the countryside and result in hazardous waste contaminating both wildlife and the land.
It is an illegal activity and carries a huge fine for those found guilty of the act, but did you know that as a householder you could be fined for not hiring a legitimate firm to remove your waste?
With an ever-increasing need to be aware of environmental issues, and the cost of fly tipping in the UK, here’s what you should know.
What is fly tipping?
Fly tipping is the term used to describe waste materials and products which are dumped illegally. The activity can take place anywhere but in many cases it is rural land and the countryside which are targeted as suitable sites to fly tip, because it’s easier to get away without being seen.
All kinds of waste materials might be fly tipped, from an excess of domestic waste to appliances such as refrigerators, freezers and washing machines. Builders’ and construction waste may also be fly tipped to avoid costs, along with vehicle parts, tyres, animal waste or hazardous materials.
Fly tipping costs local councils millions of pounds every year to clear up, and carries the potential to cause serious harm to the land, wildlife or children playing who encounter it. Those clearing up fly tipped waste also have to be very careful in case materials such as asbestos or medical waste are present.
Who’s responsible for clearing fly-tipping?
The law treats fly tippers very seriously and carries the potential for a prison sentence of up to 5 years, as well as a fine of up to £50,000 in the Magistrates Courts, or if the case is heard in the Crown Court, an unlimited fine.
Assets and bank accounts can also be seized and frozen as a result of any conviction, plus guilty parties could be liable for clean-up costs. These can run into hundreds of thousands of pounds and will be added on top of any fines.
However, although the law treats fly tippers very seriously, they aren’t the only ones who are considered to be responsible.
A recent case saw a householder in Somerset fined for using a contractor who advertised on Facebook to dispose of their waste. The contractor did not dispose of the waste responsibly as the householder believed they would, and instead fly tipped it. The waste was traced back to the house holder who was then fined by the courts for not using a legitimate firm.
Under the Environmental Protection Act, householders could be charged up to £5000 if they fail to take “reasonable measures” to ensure that the waste disposal company they hire is authorised to do so.
Therefore, although the law considers fly tippers legally responsible, house holders can also face a substantial penalty for failing to use a legitimate waste disposal company. Each case will be considered individually, with the courts deciding whether the proper due care and attention was exercised in choosing an appropriate waste management firm.
What you can do to protect yourself from fly-tipping
When you’re looking for a
waste management company
, ensure that you only ever hire someone who is registered and licensed by the Environment Agency. A reputable company will also be happy to share details of their license number so you can check their credentials.
The company should be fully insured and when the rubbish is removed you should be given a Duty of Care waste transfer note.
Reston Waste Management is fully registered and licensed by the Environment Agency
. Our Waste Carriers Registration Number is TNE/376953 and we are fully committed to abiding by only lawful practices.

Can Waste Management Reduce Your Carbon Footprint?,https://www.restonwaste.co.uk/news/can-waste-management-reduce-your-carbon-footprint/,"Can Waste Management Reduce Your Carbon Footprint?
Reducing your carbon footprint, whether at work or home, is a relatively easy thing to do. Not only is it good for the environment, but it can also help to save you time, money and effort; particularly if everyone pulls together. Here’s how waste generation could affect the size of your carbon footprint.
How your waste generation affects your carbon footprint
If your company generates copious amounts of waste, and it’s not disposed of responsibly or correctly, then the impact it can have on the environment could be massive. Your irresponsibly disposed waste could result in:
High levels of pollution
– landfill waste can, if not dealt with properly, release a pollutant called leachate into nearby groundwater, thus having a detrimental effect on plants and animals living in the surrounding areas. Sadly, increased levels of waste generation can increase the chances of leachate pollution
Lack of biodiversity
– landfill sites are easily filled and so new locations for the creation of additional landfill sites are needed. As such, forests could be torn down, lakes drained or greenbelt land flattened to accommodate this. As a result, animals and plants will lose habitats, displacing them for the foreseeable future. This could even lead to the extinction of certain species, particularly if the process is continued.
An increased amount of litter
– lightweight materials which cannot/have not been recycled could end up being blown into oceans, woodland or other natural areas. Plastic bags and food wrappers are some of the most common items to end up in the ocean, which will then break down over an extremely long period of time. As the materials break down into smaller pieces, they can be ingested by marine life, resulting in health deteriorations or even death.
A pest control problem
– landfill sites draw in a variety of different animals, insects and other pests. Not only will they stay in and around the area where the landfill site is located, but they could also venture out to nearby homes or businesses, leaving you with an infestation.
Recycling and waste reduction
Recycling is a key part of waste reduction, and subsequently, it’s an effective way of reducing your carbon footprint. However, it’s often believed that recycling alone isn’t enough to make a difference to the environment. There are other, often very simple, ways in which waste can be reduced in the workplace, including:
Using both sides of the paper
Shredding or reusing paper
Reusing boxes
Avoiding printing in colour
Buying paper which is chlorine-free or made from an alternative material, such as bamboo, hemp or organic cotton
Creating a policy whereby your employees have a paper allowance – this will encourage employees to go paperless
Emailing memos around the workplace
Storing large documents (such as employee handbooks) online
Installing hand dryers as opposed to paper towels
Altering margin settings so the printer uses less paper
Buying used office supplies (such as tables and drawers)
Purchasing second-hand photocopiers and printers
Switching to energy-saving light bulbs
Turning off lights when not in use
Shutting computers and other electrical equipment down when not in use
3 Ways you could benefits from reducing waste in the office
You will save money
You’ll be complying with waste regulations (depending on the industry you work in)
You’ll be lowering your carbon footprint
Ways to reduce your carbon footprint
There are many steps that can be taken to reduce your carbon footprint, whether you’re a homeowner or a business owner, you can incorporate the following tips into your everyday life. From learning about the 5 R’s to buying local produce, we can all get onboard with environmentally friendly ways of living and working.
Learn about and implement the 5 R’s These are fairly simple to remember: 
Refuse – refrain from using single use plastics and paper
Reduce – be more mindful of what you buy and what you actually use (such as food)
Reuse – buy reusable products or repair and upcycle existing, worn out products
Rot – establish a compost heap and throw food scraps and old fruit and veg on it
Recycle – if you have acquired a recyclable material that cannot be reused, recycle it
Encourage and take part in cycle schemes and car share incentives
Cycle schemes and car shares can work well when everyone works together to encourage these incentives. Whether you give a prize to the person who has cycled the furthest or reward someone who has cycled into work an impressive number of times, this should entice others to get involved to be in with a chance of winning a prize.
Employers could also offer a monetary incentive for car sharing, perhaps paying for a certain amount of petrol or simply offering prizes. Slowly but surely, you’ll find your employees will be more than happy to opt for a more environmentally friendly commute.
Do your best to conserve water This can be done both at home and in the workplace. Tips for conserving water at home include: 
Turning the tap off when you brush your teeth or shave
Turning the shower off when applying shampoo and body wash, or when shaving
Don’t flush things down the toilet to get rid of them – it could waste between 5-7 gallons of water
Have a bath instead of a shower – this method won’t use nearly as much water as a ten minute shower
Don’t set off the dishwasher unless you have a full load
Only use your washing machine for full loads
Don’t keep the tap running when cleaning vegetables
Don’t keep the taps running when washing dishes by hand
Tips for conserving water in the workplace include:
Install low-flow toilets and water-efficient urinals
Regularly check taps and toilets for leaks
Put up some signs to encourage workers turn the tap off when lathering hands with soap
Install taps which only run for a certain amount of time, turning off automatically
Educate your employees about the importance of water conservation
Install water-efficient dishwashers
Buy food and other items locally
If your company has a free fruit and veg scheme, or if you have milk delivered on a regular basis, see if any local shops provide a delivery service. Greengrocers and farm shops are more likely than ever to have an online service whereby customers can order produce, much like ordering your shopping from a large supermarket chain. Greengrocers and farm shops will (typically) be able to provide you with: 
Fruit
Vegetables
Milk
Bread
Salt
Pepper
Sugar
Jam
Fresh fruit juice
Biscuits
 Other items and services an office would be able to buy locally include: 
Stationery
Printing services
Hand washes with natural ingredients (catering for those with different skin types)
Coffee (from a local, independent coffee shop)
Cards (to send to customers/clients/employees during the Christmas period, for example)
Switch to sustainable energy
During this time, it’s more common than ever for households and businesses alike to be more environmentally aware, and so many are making the switch to sustainable, or renewable energy sources. These can include:
Solar power – production of electricity through conversion on energy from sunlight
Solar heating – the process of heating up water through the conversion of sunlight
Wind power – wind turbines are used to generate electricity
Hydropower – the energy from fast-running or falling water is used to create power
Biomass – energy produced from plant material or animal residues
Biofuels – fuel created from harvested plants or crops
Geothermal – thermal energy stored within the Earth
Marine energy – created by tidal/ocean waves and differing ocean temperatures

5p bag charge unveiled – but at what cost?,https://www.restonwaste.co.uk/news/5p-bag-charge-unveiled-cost/,"5p bag charge unveiled – but at what cost?
The government has rolled out the new scheme forcing large retailers to charge for providing single use bags to customers in England. This initiative has already been in place in other parts of the UK, such as Wales, for some time now and has proven to have had a significant impact on waste, recycling and litter.
However, there are some concerns that it might have a negative impact on waste disposal in the home.
The new legislation
According to government figures, in 2014 a total of 7.6 billion plastic bags were handed out in England by the big supermarkets alone.
Under the new rules, retailers who have 250 employees or more will be forced to charge 5p for every single use bag their customers use.
Although this initiative will be used to raise money for charity rather than provide retailers with profit, it’s proven to be an unpopular decision for some of shoppers in the country.
Environmentalists on the other hand believe the change is positive, and would like to see it extended further to include small shops and businesses, so that there are no exclusions. Plastic cause not just problems with waste disposal and littering, but also can be lethal if they end up as marine pollution, harming wildlife.
In Wales where the 5p bag charge has been mandatory for some time, the use of plastic bags plunged by 70% in the first three years the new rules were in place.
The government is hoping that similar results will be seen in England, targeting an 80% decrease in supermarkets and a 50% drop for high street stores.
If the numbers fall as expected, around £730 million will be raised for charity, land fill waste will be reduced and street litter cleaning costs will fall by £60 million.
Exclusions
Not all shopping will be subjected to the new 5p levy as the government has granted a number of allowable exceptions.
Only shops that have the equivalent of 250 full time employees will be forced to charge for their bags, smaller shops are currently excused from the new legislation.
In addition, shops at airports or on trains, as well as goods which require bags for safety purposes such as raw meat or fish (or other food products which should be covered or wrapped for health reasons), blades, prescription medicines, bulbs or seeds and live fish. Paper bags are also excluded from the levy.
Impact on domestic waste disposal?
Although the plastic bags handed out by supermarkets and other retailers are marketed as single use, many customers used them as bin liners in the home.
Now faced with the choice between paying for multiple bags, or going without, there are concerns about whether everyone will be keen to fork out for black bin bags.
This could mean an increase in waste being placed in bins for waste collection without being bagged, leaving bins smelly, dirty and unpleasant.
And some consumers are angry that they are the ones being left to pick up the bill for plastic bags, with manufacturers and retailers free to continue to use excess packaging on a far greater scale. Some customers have suggested that their bins have far fewer plastic bags than unnecessary plastic packaging in, and believe that the government is targeting the wrong market.
This view is backed up by the UK Packaging and Film Association who believe the change should have been used as an opportunity to promote recycling and re-use. The CEO, Barry Turner, suggested that plastic bags form a very small proportion of the litter in the UK, and that the emphasis should have been on tackling other types of litter and the need to recycle.

Complete guide to hiring a skip,https://www.restonwaste.co.uk/news/complete-guide-hiring-skip/,"Complete guide to hiring a skip
If you have too much rubbish to fit in your bin, or you simply don’t want to take up all the room with household waste, you might want to consider
hiring a skip
.
Building work, refurbishment, clearances or even garden work could all benefit from using a skip to remove the waste.
But if you’ve never hired a skip before, you might have some questions about how it all works; our complete guide to skip hire explains just how simple the process is.
What size skip should I hire?
If there’s any doubt at all about the
size of skip
you should hire, it’s better to go bigger than smaller.
All skips are measures in cubic yards; as a very rough guide, one metric ton takes up a cubic yard. To give you an idea, around 344 house bricks weigh one metric ton. If you’re planning on filling your skip with rubble or soil, an 8 yard skip is usually the maximum available for hire because of the weight restrictions.
Here’s a guide to the various size skips and their common uses:
4 cubic yards – this midi skip is perfect for small home refurbishments such as bathrooms or kitchens, where bulky components such as doors, cupboards and cabinets may need to be disposed of. A 4 yard skip is also ideal for garden clearances.
6 cubic yards – a slightly larger skip which is ideal for jobs around the home where there will be more waste such as roof tiles, bricks, wood and soil. Waste which is heavier and small building jobs will typically use this size skip.
8 cubic yards – often used for the same types of purposes as a 6 yard skip, the 8 yard version just provides a bit more space. This is the largest skip you can use for weight-intensive waste.
10-12 cubic yards – these larger skips have a lower weight restriction than the 8 yard skip, but provide the advantage of having more room. This allows multiple large items to be held, which is particularly useful for house and office clearances. Don’t forget to check the restrictions on what you are allowed to throw away.
An alternative to hiring a metal skip is to use other waste management services, such as a skip bag which can be used for smaller amounts or lighter waste.
What can’t be put in a skip?
Although the majority of household waste can be placed into a skip, there are some exceptions.
Any items which could be deemed to be hazardous or are excluded for environmental purposes cannot be thrown into a skip.
We can advise you more specifically on what items can’t be included, but as a general guide, the following would normally be prohibited:
oil, petrol or diesel
solvents
liquids
medical or clinical waste
fluorescent tubes
gas bottles
asbestos
toxic materials
tyres
batteries
computer monitors and TVs
freezers and fridges
paint cans
electrical equipment
Can I place the skip on the road?
In most cases it’s possible to have the skip on the road if you don’t have room on your premises but you will need to get a permit from the council in advance. Normally the largest skip which will be approved for use on a public highway is 8 yards.
Any skips which will be remaining on a public highway overnight must be covered and also have a light affixed.
Skips which are placed on private property
don’t have the same requirements.
If you want to place the skip on the road, we can arrange the permit on your behalf; just let us know when you make the booking. Contact us today to

Have you put your recycling out?,https://www.restonwaste.co.uk/news/have-you-put-your-recycling-out/,"Have you put your recycling out?
We all produce waste in our home, some more than others but we all need to make use of the recycling facilities that our local council provide for us. Recycling is vitally important if we are to make an impact on the environment and prevent there from being more and more landfill sites.
Most items within a household in terms of rubbish that is put into the household waste bin can be recycled. Even items such as clothing and furniture can also be recycled. In order for recycling to take place, the local authority hires a waste management company and they will ensure that all waste, including recycling is collected, managed, sorted and disposed of responsibly.
Waste management companies know everything there is to know about waste removal and they will collect and dispose of almost any type of waste that a household or business produces. There are waste management companies that also specialise in certain types of waste such as construction waste or medical waste and they are the experts when it comes to the field of waste management. The

company will handle all of the recycling and other waste that you have collected professionally.

It would be crazy to think that we could carry on regardless when it comes to our
waste collection
in the UK. The government both past and present have worked hard to encourage individuals to recycle as much as possible to ensure that there is little waste being sent to a landfill site by waste clearance companies.
There are landfill sites located in most major towns and cities to service the waste that is produced in that location. Typically, each local authority has a specific waste clearance company that they employ to undertake the collection, removal and disposal of all waste that is produced within a specific area.
Waste collection company’s commitments
The waste clearance company ensure as much waste as possible is sent to the recycling plant so that it can be reused as other items that you find in the supermarket and other locations. Only the items that really cannot be reused are disposed of in a landfill site, however, the government wish to reduce this even further so that landfill sites eventually become obsolete. We all need to realise our responsibilities and start to assist in the reduction of waste that is sent to landfill sites by recycling as much as possible both in the home and also in the workplace.

Have you done a lot of work on your house this weekend but there is too much waste to be taken to the tip by car and you think that you might produce more over the coming weeks because you are doing a significant amount of work on your home? Then it might be time for you to consider hiring a skip.
Hiring a skip means that you will have a skip placed on your drive or on the road outside your home for you to fill with all of the waste that you have produced as a result of the work to your home, which is being undertaken. The skip can be filled with almost any type of waste and the
waste management
company that you hired the skip from will come and remove it once it has been filled.
Skip hire
is relatively easy and skips come in a range of different
sizes
so that you can get the right size of skip for the waste that you are looking to have removed and the amount that you think might be produced. If you fill one skip and still have more to remove, the full skip can be easily replaced with a new empty skip.

Recycling is an issue that we should all be aware of and we should all be doing our upmost to ensure that we are doing what we can to prevent the collection and disposal of waste significantly impacting on the environment.
Although you might not think about it too often, the amount of waste that you put into your household waste bin can add to the amount of waste that ends up in a landfill site that will not rot or decompose and therefore will sit in the ground for many years to come and potentially cause a health hazard.
By recycling your waste, you are reducing the amount of rubbish that goes to landfill and also doing your bit for the environment because it can be recycled and reused as something else that you might find on the supermarket shelf or another form of packaging. Recycled materials can also be used to make aeroplanes and cars which is really quite amazing.
Recycling once it has been collected from your home will be taken to a plant for sorting and cleaning. All of the items are sorted into categories and sent on to the relevant place in order for it to be made into something new.

Would it be great if we lived in a society where we didn’t have to worry about the waste that we produce and we could concentrate on more important things in life? However, waste management in the UK is a real and serious issue that needs to be addressed.
National government has many guidelines in place to ensure that all waste is removed from households and businesses on a regular basis so that it can be disposed of in the correct manner. However, we are no where near meeting the targets set for making Britain zero waste. In order to become a zero waste national, everybody including manufacturers, food companies and supermarkets need to think about how food and other items are packaged and increase the amount of packaging that can be recycled.
Recycling should be on the top of agenda when it comes to dealing with your household waste. Every local authority in the UK provides some kind of recycling facilities for its residents and you may need to ring your local council to find out what is going on in your area if you don’t know already. The council may even provide you with a specific bin for your recycling.

When waste is misused and misunderstood, it ends up being handled incorrectly and waste is disposed of in the wrong way which eventually leads to problems in the vicinity, as well as affecting those around where the waste has been handled or disposed of.
However when a

We are very lucky in the UK that we are not a third world country and that we have the infrastructure in place to deal with the waste that is produced on a daily basis. It is essential to get a firm grip on the waste that is produced and subsequently disposed of so that it does not have an adverse affect on our environment and cause to the problems that other countries are experiencing.

There have been calls over recent weeks to change the way in which we recycle bottles in the UK. This has been in response to the need to reduce the amount of waste that we produce and also the amount of litter that is seen on the streets of all major towns and cities.
The Campaign for the Protection of Rural England has put forward a suggestion that all bottles when they are sold have a deposit placed on them that when they are given in to a recycling plant or specific location, the deposit which has been paid is returned to the owner of the bottle.
The deposits that are currently being suggested for the bottles range from 15p for a 500ml bottle to 30p for any bottle larger than 500ml. This would mean that this deposit would have to be worked into the price of the item and there would need to be some form of regulation to ensure that the money is returned.
There is a cost associated to the recycling of bottles and also to the many clean up operations that have to take place in the UK as a result of others being careless with their litter, but this scheme may take a while to take off because although it encourages individuals to recycle, it might be rather more difficult to implement.

Environment pollution is a serious issue mainly in the event of massive industrialisation taking place throughout the world. Regular disposal of waste from factories is adding to the pollution level.
According to the 2012 World Bank report, waste from the industries and households in the cities will show a warning increase in coming years. The UK cities too have a fair share of similar problems due to the rapid urbanisation and more industrial setups.
Waste comes from both domestic areas and industrial units. The waste regularly emitted by the industrial units and disposed of by the household sectors are posing threats to the environment and creating several health hazards. In absence of a proper waste management system, the problem will intensify at a staggering pace. This stresses on the need of professional services to ensure a better and safer waste disposal system.
A Hope for Safe & Green Economy
Environment is in the thick of crisis, and we must share our responsibility towards it. It is our negligence and ignorance that has led to such a disaster. And if we still prefer not to adopt any measure; we have no way but to pay a price for it. Every individual and industry must take initiatives to mitigate the harmful effects caused by such rubbishes. In many countries, the industries are obliged to follow certain rules and regulations, laid down by the government.
After the government, it is the business sector that needs to play its part because maximum waste is generated during manufacturing and production processes. In addition, these wastes are thrown in the surrounding areas without even considering the devastating impact of this careless act on environment. In the UK, there are several waste management companies. They help the manufacturing units set up systems for waste disposal so that these trashes are disposed in an environment-friendly manner.
As environment pollution is a much talked about issue, these companies are trying to introduce more advanced measures to keep environment cleaner and safer. The companies are encouraged to use recycled products. These are manufactured by recycling the waste materials which often include hazardous items and other trashes.
While choosing waste disposal service, it is always better to consider a bigger picture. Some companies offer such service as a part of their wider waste management facilities. These companies provide tailored-made service according to one’s requirements.
Last but not the least, each one of us must put in an earnest effort to make this world safe and healthy to live in.

It is shocking to think how much waste we produce as a nation, but when you consider how much of this waste goes to a landfill site where it takes many years to biodegrade, it is even more shocking.

Although this figure is creeping up, it isn’t moving quickly enough to enable us to meet our target of recycling 70% of our waste by 2025.

In a nutshell, nobody actually knows what the consequences will be for the UK when (or indeed IF) the government invokes Article 50 of the EU Treaty, both in terms of recycling laws or indeed any other laws. These are uncharted waters and the only thing that can be said for certain is that there will be uncertainty – a great deal of uncertainty.
With environmental issues not having featured highly on the referendums campaign manifesto, it is likely that they will not be high on the government’s list as they navigate the UK out of the EU in what is predicted to be a lengthy process.
In the short term
In the short-term
waste management
businesses should expect no changes to take place in respect of recycling laws in the UK, and they should carry on exactly as they do now. Existing waste management laws will still apply and contracts that are in place will still need to be fulfilled. It should be remembered that with many of the environmental laws in the UK implementing international treaties and agreements we would still be bound by them – the Basel Convention on Transboundary Movements of Waste being the most obvious of these.
Long term scenario 1
If the UK come to an agreement with the EU that gives full access to the single market, then it is highly likely that EU environmental laws will still apply. This includes all laws that pertain to waste management as well. As a non-EU member however we would no longer have influence over the creation of new laws, as these are decisions that only EU members can vote on. Certain environmental laws could cease to apply in which case the government would need to make a decision on laws and policies in those areas, the Birds and Habitats Directives, amongst others.
Long term scenario 2
With environmental issues often pushed aside it is possible that the UK could negotiate a withdrawal agreement that does not include the need to continue to apply EU environmental laws here. The government might decide to continue with current waste management laws as they stand, because keeping them regulated makes sense. However, lowering the standards would give greater freedom to rogue operators.
Long term scenario 3
A third possible scenario is that in the event the UK does not have to apply EU laws, the government will be able to develop their own waste management laws and policies. The major stumbling point with such a scenario would be if some parts of the UK choose to create more stringent laws whilst others are laxer and choose to get rid of environmental laws and policies especially if they consider them a barrier to economic growth This would of course take into account any current laws and policies that implement international treaties and agreements.
In conclusion
Whilst we can speculate about what the possible outcome might be in terms of recycling laws nobody knows what the future holds, and with a leadership election currently taking place within the ruling party, it will be a while before anyone is in a position to push the metaphorical button that begins the whole Article 50 process. The UK waste industry, just like other UK industries, will just have to wait and see what happens.

Announcements that are due to affect the waste management and rubbish collection industry
However, there were a number of announcements that will affect the waste management industry and these include; an increased landfill tax of £8 per tonne until at least 2014, which in turn creates a floor under the tax at £80 per tonne until at least 2020.
This will mean that local authorities if they own a landfill site will be charged for the amount of waste that they send to a landfill rather than having it recycled. Similarly, if the landfill is privately owned, the business will be charged for receiving the waste from the waste management companies.
In addition, it is worth bearing in mind that all waste management and rubbish collection issues come under the branch of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Department which will need to reduce its budget by at least 25% by 2015.

Many people wonder what happens to their
rubbish collection
and recycling once it has been taken away from their home. In most instances, the rubbish collection and recycling waste is collected separately and taken to different depots to be sorted and disposed of.
From rubbish collection to a landfill site
During rubbish collection, the general household waste is sometimes sorted before being dumped into a landfill site, whereas recycling is taken to a special warehouse where each recyclable material is separated and taken away to a plant, which deals specifically with that item. Some recyclables such as plastic and glass are melted down and made into new plastic and glass items, whereas paper and tins are sent away to be made into completely new things altogether.
It is amazing how much we can actual recycle from our waste disposal items if we put our minds to it and if we all took a little time out when putting items into the bin for the rubbish collection, we would significantly reduce the amount of waste disposal that we send to landfill sites. In Britain alone we produce approximately 300 millions tonnes of rubbish which is truly outstanding and needs to be addressed if we are to become a more sustainable nation.

5 surprising things that CAN be recycled,https://www.restonwaste.co.uk/news/5-surprising-things-can-recycled/,"5 surprising things that CAN be recycled
As we strive to be a more environmentally conscious nation, recycling is becoming increasingly important. Most people know the basics, thanks to the provision of household recycling bins that the council empties on a regular basis. Paper and Cardboard, Cans, bottles and even garden or food waste all of these can be recycled easily. Whilst there are plenty of things that can be recycled there are still many that can’t – but not as much as you’d think. With this in mind, we’ve put together a list of 5 surprising things that can, in fact, be recycled
1. Nappies
Whilst it comes as no surprise that reusable (cloth) nappies can be recycled, disposable nappies are a different matter. A UK based company called Knowaste have developed a method of doing just that. Nappies are sanitised before being separated out into the different components, the plastics are recycled into roof shingles and the paper pulps turned into wallpaper. With the average child using approximately 5000 nappies in the first 2 years of their life this could save a lot of landfill.
2. Chewing Gum
It costs councils a staggering 150million each year to clear up chewing gum litter from UK streets but Gumdrop Ltd, a London based company have come up with a way of recycling chewing gum and turning it into compounds that can be used in the rubber and plastics industries, creating anything from wellington boots to mobile phone covers.
3. Used Bras
You would be right in thinking that charity shops won’t take these but they are still recyclable. Smalls for All is a Scottish based charity that collects bras to send to women in the poorest areas of Africa. Gently worn garments are passed on whilst damaged or older bras are taken apart and recycled to raise funds to buy more bras.
4. Compact Disks
Disks in good condition that you just don’t want any more can be donated to charity, given to a friend or even sold. But what about damaged disks? Obviously, they can’t be placed in the plastic recycling bins. These can, however now be recycled via several companies but you will have to mail the cd’s to them. They are shredded down and then melted before being given new life in the automotive or building materials industries.
5. Mattresses
20 million mattresses end up in landfill each year, however that number could see a decrease as an increasing number of private companies have begun to recycle them. This process involves breaking them down into their various materials, bundling them up and sending them to plants that deal specifically with each type of material – where they are given a new lease of life.
Of course, larger amounts of waste can be much more complicated, and if it’s bigger pickups you need we’d be delighted to help – whether by supplying skip hire, grab hire in London, or waste clearance services for your home or business premises. That way, the removal of waste to the right places is all taken care of professionally.

It is surprising how much food we put into our household waste bins and how much of that food is actually still ok to eat. There has been publicity recently over the amount of food that is wasted in this country and what we should be doing in order to prevent there being a large amount of good food being sent to a landfill site by the rubbish clearance companies.
Respecting the voice of rubbish clearance companies
We can all do our bit to prevent the amount of waste that is being sent by
rubbish clearance
companies to landfill sites in the UK and there are many ways in which to reduce the amount of food that we put into our household waste bin. This includes ensuring that we buy food within the sell by and use by date and use it all in any way possible. In some instances, food can be frozen or refrigerated to ensure their longevity.
Waste clearance
companies as well as collecting our general household waste, also collect recyclable waste, which includes plastics, bottles and tin cans. You could introduce a compost heap to your garden to put certain types of food so that you can have some top quality compost for your garden in order to reduce your rubbish clearance amounts. The landfills will certainly appreciate you making effort to reduce your household waste that potentially will be travelling to the

Recycling needs to play a large role in our daily lives and aside from the recycling that we do at home, there is also recycling that we can do in the workplace too! A staggering amount of paper is used in offices up and down the country and much of it might be unnecessary printing. If you have printed unnecessarily and you no longer need it, you should be putting any waste paper into a recycling bin.
Taking charge to diminish waste clearance
Most large office buildings and complexes have a waste clearance company that handles their waste and the rubbish clearance company will ensure that any waste that is produced is recycled if necessary and disposed of in the correct manner. We are all responsible for our waste and we should ensure that we are doing everything possible to reduce the amount of waste that waste clearance companies take to a landfill site.

The plastic bottle and cardboard recycling trial will only be done on certain street in Dudley but it could be rolled out across the borough and it could become a nationwide scheme.
Each of the households will be given new recycling bags, one of which will be use for cardboard and paper with the other being used for plastic, tins and drink cans. They will be collected on a fortnightly basis along with other household waste.
The Council is hoping that by introducing an enhanced recycling scheme that more people will become interested in recycling and start to make a difference. There are still householders that do not recycling because they think that it is too difficult, however, in actual fact, recycling is really easy and it can be accommodated into your daily routine very easily.

According to local records, recycling rates in the area of Harrogate have been appalling in comparison to the rest of the county. However, the residents are arguing that if recycling can be improved in the area, there won’t be any need for the incinerating plant. However, encouraging individuals as well as businesses to recycling is very difficult and there will need to be a vast improvement in the services which are provided by a local authority.
However, the North Yorkshire County Council realise that there will always be a need to incinerate and treat waste so there will always be a need for the incinerating plant.

The responsibility of the waste clearance
In the UK, every local authority needs to provide waste collection for their residence.

Each local authority uses a different waste collection company or waste management company to collect the waste in their area.

At the sorting plant all waste that has been collected is sorted to ensure that there is nothing being put into a landfill site that can be recycled. There is a lack of landfill sites in the UK and there are many government policies in place to encourage individuals to recycle as much of their waste as possible.

Although these plans in theory may seem like a good idea to some, in practice, it would have been a completely different matter.

Litter epidemic in Britain,https://www.restonwaste.co.uk/news/litter-epidemic-in-britain/,"Litter epidemic in Britain
There have been reports over the past few weeks about the litter problem that Britain is currently suffering. It appears that some local authorities have only just realised the problems that we are suffering as a nation when it comes to litter and there has been little in the way of trying to tackle the problem even though we are spending a huge amount of money on supposed clean up operations.
Keep Britain Tidy undertook a survey of local authorities in England and showed that in the last year almost £100 million has been spent on employing litter pickers and buying equipment to help clean up litter including chewing gum removal equipment.
The Campaign to Protect Rural England says that Britain is suffering from a litter epidemic and we need to start changing our attitudes towards how we dispose of litter when we are out and about. Although most of us are very responsible when it comes to our waste, there are some individuals who cause problems for the masses. Ultimately, the £100 million bill is going to be passed on from local authorities to the residents through their council tax bill and in effect we are paying to clean the streets that we make dirty.

Waste collection arguments in Parliament,https://www.restonwaste.co.uk/news/arguments-in-parliament-over-waste-collection/,"Waste collection arguments in Parliament
In parliament there are reports that there has been a falling out between the coalition ministers over which Whitehall department is going to be in charge of
rubbish collection
and recycling policy. According to some politicians, the responsibility for waste collection and recycling within the Government is a complete and utter ‘shambles’ and is in desperate need for reform.
This news is not encouraging and if they cannot decide who is going to make the decisions when it comes to waste management, recycling and
rubbish collection
, then how are companies and local authorities expected to run at a grass roots level?
Rubbish collection and waste disposal management
Managing waste and the rubbish collection at the best of times can be very challenging indeed, with most local authorities hiring
waste management
companies to deal with the householder and business waste collections on their behalf. These waste management companies know all there is to know about waste collection and its disposal to ensure that the waste does not pose any health threats to the public.
In order for the removal and disposal of waste to run effectively and efficiently, there needs to be a suitable amount of legislation in place.

Local authorities joining forces to tackle waste removal,https://www.restonwaste.co.uk/news/local-authorities-joining-forces-to-tackle-waste-removal/,"Local authorities joining forces to tackle waste removal
In order to save money as part of the Coalition Government’s new bid to reduce the amount of spending and thus cut the country’s budget deficit, many local authorities are joining forces to tackle a variety of issues, one of which is for their waste management .
The collection and disposal of household and business waste for a local authority is a considerable cost and if there is an opportunity to reduce the amount of money required it would be particularly useful.
Waste management by the council
Tamworth Borough Council and Lichfield District Council are joining forces in order to deliver a new shared waste management and recycling service that will save their council tax payers approximately half a million pounds every year. In addition, they will also be reducing the amount of trucks on the road which are required to collect the waste.
All residents who are going to be affected by this merge will be contacted so that they know when their waste and recycling will be collected and also to inform them of what can and cannot be recycled. It is hoped that along with saving a considerable amount of money, it will also encourage those who do not already recycle, join in and start separating their waste.

You may have been recycling for some time but there are some places in the UK which are only latching onto the idea of reducing the waste that is sent to landfill and are finally coming round to the idea that recycling is the way forward when it comes to waste collection.

East Renfrewshire Council are introducing new food waste collection and rubbish bin uplifts are going to become fortnightly rather than weekly in a bid to encourage individuals to start recycling. There will continue to be weekly waste collection of garden waste which is where residents will be dumping their food waste.

Giving a boost to the WRAP campaign,https://www.restonwaste.co.uk/news/giving-a-boost-to-the-wrap-campaign/,"Giving a boost to the WRAP campaign
According to a report out today, there is a campaign which will see the promotion of less waste and more recycling. This campaign is being run by the Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) which is funded by the Government. Although this campaign was launched in 2007 with the aim to reduce the amount of consumer food waste by March 2010 by at least 250,000 it appears that we are far from reaching this target and the campaign needs a boost.
Although the campaign has made some headway in reducing the amount of rubbish we dispose of and it estimates that 2 million households have reduce their food waste, there is still a need to try and do more if we can.
It is important that everybody jumps onto the recycling band wagon if it is ever to be successful and it simply won’t work if some people decide not to do it. Recycling should be something that everybody does and it isn’t difficult to start separating the various pieces of rubbish and putting into the correct bin on collection day. It would certainly make a difference to the world in which we live in and also prevent the amount of recyclable waste that ends up in a landfill site.

With most local authorities being forced to cut their spending habits and find new ways of saving money, there were many who believed that the
waste clearance
of household and business waste would be severely affected. However, in most instances, so far this hasn’t been the case.
We are all aware of our recycling and waste disposal duties and most of us diligently separate our waste to ensure that whatever can be recycled is recycled, with only the bare minimum going to a landfill site. However, there are some items that are still not recyclable in some boroughs, whereas they are recyclable in others. Most authorities only collect glass, paper, cardboard and cans, with some opting to recycling plastics.
Good news for waste clearance at Tewkesbury
In Tewkesbury, kerbside recycling has been extended to include even more items than before for the waste disposal to ensure that the amount of waste that householders send to a landfill site is reduced even further. You can even recycle your biscuit tins, greetings cards and wrapping paper! This has led to a ‘dramatic improvement’ in the number of people choosing to recycle the waste disposal in Tewkesbury and the local authority is hoping that the momentum is going to continue into the future.

Whatever type of waste it might be, it needs to be disposed of in the correct manner. When it comes to household waste, our local authority has a
rubbish clearance company
come and collect our waste from our homes and dispose of it at a landfill site or takes items that can be recycled to a recycling plant. If this wasn’t done, the waste would become dangerous and could cause serious health problems.

companies have a wealth of experience when it comes to
waste disposal
and they can be hired to tackle any waste problem that you might have.

hiring a company
that knows how to handle the waste that you are producing.
Ask the waste removal company
